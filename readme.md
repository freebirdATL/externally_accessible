Hello and Welcome! This repository is used for collaborating with external AI agents to test code building and direction.

## Base Number Web App

Open `index.html` in a browser to experiment with numbers in different bases. Choose a base between 2 and 30, then use the large `-` and `+` buttons beside the centered value to decrement or increment it. The base-specific value is displayed prominently with the baseâ€‘10 equivalent shown beneath it.

## Binary Display Tester

Open `display.html` to experiment with controlling a pixel display via binary. Select a width and height between 1 and 256, choose between 1-bit black/white and 24-bit RGB modes, then paste a bitmap of `0`s and `1`s (where `1` is on/white and `0` is off/black) to render the pixels. In RGB mode, provide 24 bits per pixel.
